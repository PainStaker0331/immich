# Support the project

I've committed to this project, and I will not stop. I will keep updating the docs, adding new features, and fixing bugs. But I can't do it alone. So I need your help to give me additional motivation to keep going.

As our hosts in the [selfhosted.show - In the episode 'The-organization-must-not-be-name is a Hostile Actor'](https://selfhosted.show/79?t=1418) said, this is a massive undertaking that the team and I are doing. And I would love to someday be able to do this full-time, and I am asking for your help to make that happen.

If you feel like this is the right cause and the app is something you are seeing yourself using for a long time, please consider supporting the project with the option below.

## Donation

* Monthly donation via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/alextran1502)
* One-time donation via [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/alextran1502?frequency=one-time&sponsor=alextran1502)

## Contribution

If you are a programmer/developer and the app's [technology stack](./technology-stack.md) is something you are familiar with, please consider contributing to the project. The team and I am always looking for new contributors. You can refer to the [contribution guildelines](/docs/contribution-guidelines) to start leaving your mark on the project.
