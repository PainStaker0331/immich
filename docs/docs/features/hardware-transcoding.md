# Hardware Transcoding [Experimental]

This feature allows you to use a GPU to accelerate transcoding and reduce CPU load.
Note that hardware transcoding is much less efficient for file sizes.
As this is a new feature, it is still experimental and may not work on all systems.

## Supported APIs

- NVENC (NVIDIA)
- Quick Sync (Intel)
- RKMPP (Rockchip)
- VAAPI (AMD / NVIDIA / Intel)

## Limitations

- The instructions and configurations here are specific to Docker Compose. Other container engines may require different configuration.
- Only Linux and Windows (through WSL2) servers are supported.
- WSL2 does not support Quick Sync.
- Raspberry Pi is currently not supported.
- Two-pass mode is only supported for NVENC. Other APIs will ignore this setting.
- Only encoding is currently hardware accelerated, so the CPU is still used for software decoding and tone-mapping.
- Hardware dependent
  - Codec support varies, but H.264 and HEVC are usually supported.
    - Notably, NVIDIA and AMD GPUs do not support VP9 encoding.
  - Newer devices tend to have higher transcoding quality.

## Prerequisites

#### NVENC

- You must have the official NVIDIA driver installed on the server.
- On Linux (except for WSL2), you also need to have [NVIDIA Container Runtime][nvcr] installed.

#### QSV

- For VP9 to work:
  - You must have a 9th gen Intel CPU or newer
  - If you have an 11th gen CPU or older, then you may need to follow [these][jellyfin-lp] instructions as Low-Power mode is required
  - Additionally, if the server specifically has an 11th gen CPU and is running kernel 5.15 (shipped with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS), then you will need to upgrade this kernel (from [Jellyfin docs][jellyfin-kernel-bug])

## Setup

#### Basic Setup

1. If you do not already have it, download the latest [`hwaccel.transcoding.yml`][hw-file] file and ensure it's in the same folder as the `docker-compose.yml`.
2. In the `docker-compose.yml` under `immich-microservices`, uncomment the `extends` section and change `cpu` to the appropriate backend.

- For VAAPI on WSL2, be sure to use `vaapi-wsl` rather than `vaapi`

3. Redeploy the `immich-microservices` container with these updated settings.
4. In the Admin page under `Video transcoding settings`, change the hardware acceleration setting to the appropriate option and save.

#### All-In-One - Unraid Setup

##### NVENC - NVIDIA GPUs

1. In the container app, add this environmental variable: Key=`NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` Value=`all`
2. While still in the container app, change the container from Basic Mode to Advanced Mode and add the following parameter to the Extra Parameters field: `--runtime=nvidia`
3. Restart the container app.
4. Continue to step 4 of "Basic Setup".

##### Other APIs

Unraid does not currently support multiple Compose files. As an alternative, you can "inline" the relevant contents of the [`hwaccel.transcoding.yml`][hw-file] file into the `immich-microservices` service directly.

For example, the `qsv` section in this file is:

```
devices:
  - /dev/dri:/dev/dri
```

You can add this to the `immich-microservices` service instead of extending from `hwaccel.transcoding.yml`.
Once this is done, you can continue to step 3 of "Basic Setup".

## Tips

- You may want to choose a slower preset than for software transcoding to maintain quality and efficiency
- While you can use VAAPI with NVIDIA and Intel devices, prefer the more specific APIs since they're more optimized for their respective devices
