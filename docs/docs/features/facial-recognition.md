# Facial Recognition

Immich recognizes faces in your photos and videos and groups them together. You can then assign names to the faces and search for them.

The list of people is shown in the Explore page.

<img src={require('./img/facial-recognition-1.png').default} title='Facial Recognition 1' />

Upon clicking on a person, a list of assets that contain their face will be shown.

<img src={require('./img/facial-recognition-2.png').default} title='Facial Recognition 2' />

The asset detail view will also show the faces that are recognized in the asset.
