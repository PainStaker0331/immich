# Search

Immich uses Typesense as the primary search database to enable high performance search mechanism.

Typesense is a powerful search engine that can be integrated with popular natural language processing (NLP) models like CLIP and SBERT to provide highly accurate and relevant search results. Here are some benefits of using Typesense integrated search for CLIP and SBERT:

Improved Search Accuracy: Typesense uses a combination of indexing, querying, and ranking algorithms to quickly and accurately retrieve relevant search results. When integrated with CLIP and SBERT, Typesense can leverage the semantic understanding and deep learning capabilities of these models to further improve the accuracy of search results.

Faster Search Response Times: Typesense is optimized for lightning-fast search response times, making it ideal for applications that require near-instantaneous search results. By integrating with CLIP and SBERT, Typesense can reduce the time required to process complex search queries, making it even faster and more efficient.

Enhanced Semantic Search Capabilities: CLIP and SBERT are powerful NLP models that can extract the semantic meaning from text, enabling more nuanced search queries. By integrating with Typesense, these models can help to improve the accuracy of semantic search, enabling users to find the most relevant results based on the true meaning of their query.

Greater Search Flexibility: Typesense provides flexible search capabilities, including fuzzy search, partial search, enabling users to find the information they need quickly and easily. When integrated with CLIP and SBERT, Typesense can offer even greater flexibility, allowing users to refine their search queries using natural language and providing more accurate and relevant results.
